1. <caption> - table title
-what it does: Adds a title to your table.
-where to put it: Right after the <table> tag, before your rows(<tr>).

html
<table>
    <caption>Weekly Study Pal</caption>
    ...
</table>

2. Colspan- merge columns.
what it does: makes a cell stretch across multiple columns.
why: useful for section headings that span more than one columns
ex
<tr>
    <th colspan = "2">Study Plan</th>
</tr>
this will make a single cell that covers the space of two columns in that row.

3. rowspan- Merge rows
what is does: makes a cell stretch across multiple rows
why: helps when the same item (like a day) covers more than one activity.

ex.
<tr>
    <td rowspan = "2">Tuesday</td>
    <td>HTML Tables</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Practice Tables</td>
</tr>

This makes "Tuesday" appear just once but span across two rows.


use case visual summary:
imagine you're listing a day (like Tuesday), and under that day there are 
two sessions:

day     Topic
Tuesday HTML Tables
        Practice Tables

we merge the "Tuesday" cell to span both rows using rowspan = "2" so it's 
more organized and avoids repetition.
