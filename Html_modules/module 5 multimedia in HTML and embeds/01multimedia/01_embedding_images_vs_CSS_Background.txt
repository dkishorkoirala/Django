Embedding images vs CSS background

what we'll learn today
1. how to use the <img> tag properly
2. Difference between content image vs decorative images(css)
3. Best practices for responsiveness and accessibility

1. Using the <img> tag
The <img> tag is used to embed images into HTML documents.

<img src= "image/profile.jpg" alt = "Profile of a person" width= "300">

attributes:
src = source url or path to the image
alt = alternative text (important for screen readers)
width/height = size in pixels(optional, but better controlled via CSS)

2. Image Use case example
<h2>My Hobies</h2>
<img src = "guitar.jpg" alt="a person playing  a guitar" width ="300">
<p>I enjoy playing guitar</p>

Best Practice Tip:
use <img> for content images (part of the meaning).
use CSS background-image for decorative purposes only (like icons, designs).

Example in CSS(we'll learn in css soon):
body{
    background-image: url("image/background.jpg");
}

3. Mini Task - practice challenge:
create an HTML page Titled "my Favourite Things"THat includes at least 3 images, each with:
-a proper alt text
-a caption under each image using <figcaption> and <figure>

ex structure for challenge:
<figure>
    <img src = "" alt = "" width = "">
    <figcaption>Text about image</figcaption>
</figure>
