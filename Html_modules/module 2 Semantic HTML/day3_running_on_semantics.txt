why is matters:

semantic HTML helps:
-Browsers understand your content
-Search engines rank you better (SEO)
-Screen Readers assist users with disabilities
-you write cleaner, easier- to-maintain code

lesson 1: What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way
ex. include
semantic-> <header>,<footer>,<article>,<section>
non-semantic-> <div>, <span>

semantic code:
<header>\
    <h1>Welcome to Reyzual's world</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <article>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I started learning web development with passion.</p>
    </article>
</main>

<footer>
    <p>Â© 2025 Reyzual</p>
</footer>

Task:
make a simple semantic layout of a personal blog structure:
    -<header> with site name
    -<nav> with a few links
    -<main> with a <section> for "about me"
    -<footer> with copyright

Lesson 2: Semantic page structure
use semantic elements instead of divs to organize content.
element-> purpose
<header> -> Top section, often with title or nav
<nav>  -> Navigation links
<main> -> main page content
<section> -> Group of related content
<article> -> Independent content block
<aslide> -> sidebar, related info
<footer> -> Bottom of the page.

Task:
Update one of your earlier HTML pages by replacing generic <div>s with:

-<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, etc.

lesson 3: Inline vs Block-level elements
Block elements start on a new line:
<div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <ul>, <section>, etc

inline element do not start on a new line:
<a>, <span>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, etc.

Task: Create a page that mixes inline and block elements:
-inside a paragraph, use <strong>, <em> and a hyperlink.

Lesson 4: SEO Basics and Meta Tags
Search engines care about meaningful structure and meta info.

Basic <meta> tags:

<meta name ="description" content = "Reyzual's web Development Journey.">
<meta name ="keywords" content = "HTML, CSS, Django, Reyzual, Developer">
<meta name = "author" content = "Reyzual">

Task:
add meta tags in the <head> of your main page.
-write a meaningful <title>, <meta description>, and include a <header> with <h1> for the page topic
