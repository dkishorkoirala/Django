defer v/s async in script tags
when we load javascript in <head., we want to aviod blocking the page render.
script without attributes:
<script src = "script.js"></script>

page waits for script to load and execute.

with defer:
<script src = "script.js" defer></script>
loads in background, runs after HTML is parsed - best for most cases.

with async:
<script src = "script.js" async></script>
loads in background and executes as soon as it's ready, which may interrupt parsing

attribute               load order              execution time          best for
none                    blocking                as parsed               simple, inline scripts
defer                   in order                after parsing           DOM-dependent scripts
async                   Random                  when ready              independent scripts(e.g analytics)

mini task

<script src="app.js" defer></script>

2. create a basic app.js
console.log("This JS was loaded with defer!");
