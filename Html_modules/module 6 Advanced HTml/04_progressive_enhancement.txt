what is progessive Enhancement?
Definition:
building web content to work on the simplest browers first,
then enhancing with advanced features for capable browsers.

philosophy:
1. start with core content
structure your page with basic, accessible HTML.
2. Enhance with CSS
add styling for visual appeal (but site should work without it.)

3. enhance with JavaScript
add interactivity (like modals, sliders, form validation), but ensure the site still works without jS.

ex:
<button>Show Details</button>
<div id="details">Some extra info</div>

css(enhancement)
#details{
    display: none;
}

JavaScript(progressive layer):
document.querySelector("button").onclick = function(){
    document.getElementById("details").style.display = "block";
}

if js fails or is disabled, the button still shows, and user still sees the text(even if it's not toggled dynamically)

why is it important?
-accessibility: users with screen readers or older devices can still access content.
-performance: faster load times for everyone.
-resilience: app doesn't break if JS fails.

best Practices:
layer        priority              purpose
HTML        high                    content & structure
CSS         medium                  presentation
JS          low                    interactivity and behavior

mini task:
1. create a simple form that works without JavaScript
2. then add JS to enhance it- maybe auto-validation or dynamic fields.
