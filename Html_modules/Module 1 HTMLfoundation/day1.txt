lesson 1: What is HTML & how the web works

What is html?
HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the language that structures content on the web. 
it tells the browser what to show, not how to show it (that's css Job).

ex. 
<p>THis is paragraph of text.</p>

What happens when you open a website?
1. you type www.example.com into the browser.
2. the browser sends a request to a server.
3. the server responds with HTML (and may be CSS/JS.)
4. Your browser reads the HTML and displays it.

Lesson 2: Basic HTML page structure
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
<head>
    <meta charset = "UTF-8">
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>

</body>
</html>

breakdown: 
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the HTML version
<html> : wraps the whole page
<head> : info about the page(not shown to users)
<body>: All visible content (text, image, links, etc)

Task1: create your first html page
1. open VS code or any text editor.
2. create a file called index.html.
3. paste the above html code.
4. open the file in a browser (double click it).
#if the page shows, "Hello word" -Great Job!

lesson 3: HEading and paragraphs

<h1>This is an H1 heading </h1>
<h2>THis is an h2 heading</h2>
<h3> THis is an H3 </h3>

<p>THis is a paragraph. Paragaphs are used to write normal text.</p>

-headings go from <h1>(largest) to <h6>(smallest).
-use <p> to write normal text.

Task2:
-add a page title, 3 heading (like your name, job goal, favorite quote),and one paragraph.

tip:
Use Indentation to make your HTML clean and readable


Lesson 4: Lists
unordered list:
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Django</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
</ul>

ordered List:
<ol>
    <li>Learn Html</li>
    <li>Learn CSS</li>
    <li>Learn Django</li>
</ol>

Use lists when you want to show items in sequence or bullet format.

Task 3:
-add a list of your top 3 goals (ordered list)
-add a list of your favorite technologies (unordered list)

Recap:
we learned:
-what Html is and how it works
-basic structure of a web page
-headings, paragraphs, and lists
