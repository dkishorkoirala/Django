Project: Personal Contact & Feedback Page

Goal:
Create a well-structured, semantic HTML page that includes navigation, user information sections, and a fully functional feedback form.

Project Requirements:
Page Structure
* Use semantic tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
* Proper headings and meta tags
* Navigation links with `#` for scrolling to sections

Content Sections

1. About You

   * Short paragraph about yourself
   * List of favorite hobbies (unordered)
   * Learning goals (ordered list)

2. Contact Info

   * Include placeholder info like email, phone, location

3. Feedback Form

   * Inputs:

     * Name (with validation)
     * Email
     * Age (number)
     * Gender (radio)
     * Subscribe checkbox
     * Birthdate
   * Dropdown (favorite programming language)
   * Textarea for comments
   * Submit button

Extra Touches

* Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` in your form
* All `<label>` tags correctly connected via `for`
* Form should use `action="#"` and method `POST` (for now)



Bonus Challenge:
Add an `<aside>` with a fun fact or quote and include global attributes like `title`, `lang`, or `style` somewhere for practice.
